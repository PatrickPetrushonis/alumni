		<p style="font-size:18px">
			<span style="font-style:italic">The Bridgeport Hospital School of Nursing Alumnae Association I</span> has been in existence since 1906. Students who successfully complete their educational requirements at the school are eligible for membership in this professional organization at the time of graduation. Membership requires completion of an application, accompanied by payment of the Associations annual dues of ten dollars. Our Treasurer bills for renewal of membership in January of each year. Per our bylaws, this Association meets twice a year, once in the spring (April), and again in the fall (September) of each year. Announcement of these meetings are made through our newsletter, which is sent to all our active membership by mail or e-mail. These dinner meetings consist of a business session and an educational program, presented by a professional speaker who educates the attendees regarding a current topic of interest and concern to Nurses. CEU programs have been offered at our meetings. This Association offers the Bertha Stiles Scholarship to students currently attending the School of Nursing and encourages and promotes continuing education in Nursing, by offering Continuing Education Scholarships to graduate nurses interested in pursuing a higher degree in the field of Nursing. We are extremely proud of our graduates. Annually, we present gold pins to the top two scholastic achievers from that years graduating class. We maintain a close working relationship with the School of Nursing. We foster our commitment and belief in this excellent School, by having made donations of educational materials for the students to use to reinforce their learning, through computer software programs or by sponsoring students to attend their annual student nurses conventions. This Association is proud to be affiliated with Bridgeport Hospital and its School, the only existing Hospital School of Nursing in the State of Connecticut. For membership interest or questions please call, President Mary Toohey-Repko @ (203)378-9783, or Treasurer Debi Petrushonis @ (203)924-9175. You can also reach the alumni through our E-mail addresses found on the Officers page.
