		<p>To All BHSN Alumni:<br>
		</p>
		<p> You are all invited to the annual Alumni Tea sponsored by the BHSN chapter of the NSNA.  It will be held in the Elizabeth Oliver Hall lounge at the school of nursing on May 3rd from 12:00pm to 2:00pm.  This year we would like to provide the alumni with the opportunity to briefly speak to those in attendance about their particular area of nursing.  The Tea will be open to all level I and graduating students as well as alumni.  We are all eager to hear from both recent graduates, as well as seasoned experienced nurses.  If you would be interested in informally speaking for 5 &#150; 10 minutes and answering questions from future nurses, please call Caren Silhavey 384-3000 or Carolyn Netsel at 375-0304.  Otherwise please come and enjoy yourself, refreshments will be provided.  We are happy to have you attend.<br>
