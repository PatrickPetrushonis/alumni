We are hoping to plan an evening dinner dance around 7PM @ the Hotel and an 11 AM-2PM Brunch the following day, Sunday, Sept. 24th .  We are in the process of arranging a display at the Barnum museum of Nursing memorabilia that could be viewed by AAI members Saturday afternoon before the dinner.  The Hotel has agreed to hold a block of rooms at about $99/ room (King size bed/or 2 double beds). If you think you would be attending and will need a room, please let one of the Board know so that we can reserve a room for you.  If you have any memorabilia that you can copy and send to Mary Toohey-Repko or Debi Petrushonis, please let us know.  We would appreciate a good copy versus the original incase of loss.  Look to our Web site(which has changed -so sorry for the confusion  www.BHSNAA1.org) We will post updates here- you can also email me - DebPTreas@Juno.com An invitation will also be going out soon with more updates. Any changes in your careers, lives,etc, you can send me a bio email-(for our Year Book) Please put your maiden name at the time of graduation from BHSN and the year you graduated.  If you know any old classmates or BHSN grads  that wish to become an AA1 member and take part in the festivities, tell them to contact Debi,Treas. for an application to join.
