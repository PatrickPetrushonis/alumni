		<p> AAI is proud to welcome 29 graduates who have recently joined our Alumnae.  It is through our strong bonds of faithful membership that we are able to continue to give scholarships to BHSN students and our Alumnae members who continue on with their education and careers.  <br>
		</p>
		<p> Scholarships are available to any AAI member who has been in good standing for at least 2 years and is continuing their education in the health field.  You may apply for this each year, but it is only awarded to the same person twice. The amount of the scholarship depends on the number of applicants accepted.  Anyone interested in obtaining an application for a Continuing Education Scholarship, please contact Caren Silhavey, at 203-375-4553.<br>
