		<p> Mary, our President, met with Don Patterson, Saltmeadow.com recently with plans and expectations for an online alumni resource. The plan would be to have an AAI section on the BHSN web site. We would be able to share with members, officer information, meeting announcements, newsletters, scholarship info for graduate nurses, e-mail, reunion announcements, membership info, the Bylaws, along with a membership application for each new student graduating. The site can be personalized and articles can be posted by members.  Cost estimate is $1000 -$2000 for 6 pages on the site, a home page with our logo, password protection is another $1000. A $15- $35 reg. Fee and probably monthy fees of $10 -$30 to rent non-existing office space on the web.  This would be an important link to the School of Nursing to let students know that we are a viable organization- in existence for many years. A proposal will be submitted to AAI and Don will be available to attend a meeting to discuss further and answer questions.  Please contact Mary if you have any comments or suggestions.  Any further info will be discussed at the Fall meeting, Thanks. <br>
