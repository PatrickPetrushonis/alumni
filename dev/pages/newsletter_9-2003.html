		<p> The BHSN Graduation commencement was held on May 8, 2003 with 61 new graduates. There are 48 new members who have completed their applications and have submitted them to AAI.  Two pins had been awarded at graduation to Heather Hathaway, Summa Cum Laude, and Lisa Berardesca, Magna Cum Laude for their highest scholastic averages.  Congratulation to you both and the class of 2003!!!<br>
		</p>
		<p> There have been some changes at BHSN with new school uniforms.  They are maroon jackets with white pants.  Quite a change from the long dresses with bib fronts some of us remember!!  The new BHSN pins are also slightly larger with more maroon on them.  Also, for graduation, the white Nursing uniform was replaced with white graduation caps and gowns.<br>
		</p>
		<p> We have started to collect some old memorabilia to share with everyone at our 100th Anniversary in 2006.  If anyone has any old pictures, group shots, uniforms, very old caps, articles, etc, we would appreciate sharing with you.  Also, if anyone is good with organizing a committee to get our gala event underway, please contact one of the board members.<br>
		</p>
		<p> Continuing Education Scholarship applications will be reviewed and considered.  You can check our web site @ www.BHSNAA1.org and down load an application or contact Caren Silhavey @ wk 203-384-3963.<br>
