		<p> The BHSN Graduation commencement was held on Thursday, May 1, 2008, @ Fairfield University.  The 36 members of the accelerated class, who completed their nursing courses in December, 2007, joined the 57 members of the graduating class of May, 2008 for the graduation ceremony.  Our President, Mary Toohey-Repko presented the Suma Cum Laude pins to Virginie Cohen, cl&#x2019;12/07 and Patricia Brennan, cl&#x2019;5/08.  The Magma Cum Laude pins were presented to Dana Alpert, cl&#x2019;12/07 and Laurie Troy, cl&#x2019;5/08.  In the class of December, 2007, 31 nurses joined AAI and 40 nurses joined from the class of May, 2008.  Congratulations to all the graduates!!!<br>

		<p> Bridgeport Hospital School of Nursing was awarded a 5 year certification licensure to continue with the School of Nursing.  This will help BHSN to continue to train students as they have in the past for the nursing profession.   The accelerated nursing program has become very popular and will continue at the School of Nursing with the class finishing their courses in December.  They will be invited to attend the May graduation ceremonies with the regular graduating class.<br>
