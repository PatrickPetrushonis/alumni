		Great news for the Bridgeport Hospital School of Nursing. They are being recognized by the Nursing Schools Almanac 2016 ranking BHSN  as one of the best nursing school.
	</p>
	<p>
		BHSN is being ranked as one of the top nursing programs; even in our rank of #31 - all schools before us are universities with multiple advanced programs and there is no other 2 year program ahead of us in the New England States and only one in the US ranking of all vocational 2-year programs (approx. 1900 and we're #2). This is outstanding and Alumnae Members should be proud. Many thanks to our faculty and staff at BHSN.
