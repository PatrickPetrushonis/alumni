		<p>Dear Members,<br>
		</p>
		<p>As we welcome Spring, we the AAI Board members hope that all of you have faired well with this &#x201C;unpredictable&#x201D; winter we have experienced!  It is now time to plan for our annual Spring Banquet which will be held at Rose&#x2019;s Restaurant, 595 Main St., Stratford, next to Sikorsky Airport- parking in the rear.  The date is Tuesday, April 8, 2003, at 6 P.M., dinner @ 6:30 P.M.  Dinner choices are: Chicken Marsala, Center cut Pork Roast, or Sole Francese.  Appetizers, Pasta, Salad, Coffee, Tea, Dessert, Tax and Tip are included.  The BHSN AAI will be able to cover &frac12; the cost this one time to our members.  Therefore the cost per dinner will be $12.50 per person.  We would like to see as many members as possible attend this informative meeting/banquet especially after our cold, snowy winter season that is hopefully almost over! <br>
		</p>
		<p>Please send meal choices and $12.50 payment made out to BHSN AAI: to Cathy Nucera,VP, 153 Governor Trumbull Way, Trumbull, Ct 06611,  by 4/4/03.<br>
		</p>
		<p>The Speaker for the evening will be Barbara Sager, M.D. (Hormone Replacement Therapy).  This will be a very informative talk by a local Gynecologist concerning what is available now and possibly in the future.  Bring your questions/concerns.<br>
		</p>
		<p>Meet the new Senior V.P. of Patient Care Operations at Bridgeport Hospital, Tara Cortez,RN, PhD.  We will also have an update on the School of Nursing news by Carol DeBlois, Director.<br>
		</p>
		<p>The BHSN had given us a wish list of items that are needed for the Nursing Students.  AAI has donated a gift of $800.00 towards the purchase of a new Deluxe Texas Doll mannequin to enhance the students&#x2019; education. <br>
		</p>
		<p> Congrats to Alumnae members, Caren Silhavey and Susan Beardsworth, who are both being recognized in March by the American Red Cross with their Medical Award of South Eastern Fairfield County: &#x201C;Hero Award&#x201D;, for successfully resuscitating a woman while attending the same Lenten service at church in Stratford, Ct. This was a team effort on behalf of both Caren and Susan until the Stratford EMS and Firefighter first responders arrived.  What a wonderful acknowledgement for the both of them!!!!   Congratulations from all the Alumnae!!!<br>
